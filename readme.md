# Kirby Paperback Export

Export [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) CMS content for use with the [Paperback Book Maker](https://ritsuko.chuma.org/paperback/).

## What does this plugin do?

The plugin generates a lightly formatted plain text file from a set of pages specified by the user. The text file is used to create a “book” package which can be viewed on a Newton OS device.

An example of the exported file can be downloaded using the link below. The file contains all of the terms currently published on the [Newton Glossary](https://newtonglossary.com/) site.

## What is a Paperback book, you ask?

Paperback is a simple cross-platform utility created by [David Fedor](https://web.archive.org/web/20171018055006/https://thefedors.com/pobox/) that takes plain text files and quickly packages them for viewing on a Newton OS device. Since the Paperback utility only runs under classic Mac OS and Windows, an online [Paperback Book Maker](https://ritsuko.chuma.org/paperback/) was developed by [Victor Rehorst](https://github.com/chuma) for all your cross-platform needs.

## Installation

After installing the plugin using one of the methods below, visiting `yoursite.com/export/paperback` should automatically download a text file without any additional configuration.

### Download

## Options

### Table of Contents Prefix

Paperback books can include a table of contents created from the text found located in the `$page->title()` field. The following option can be added to the `site/config/config.php` file, allowing you to specify a custom table of contents prefix.

This option is not set by default.

```php
return [
	'splorp.paperback-export.prefix' => '',
];
```

Specify a prefix.

```php
return [
	'splorp.paperback-export.prefix' => ['@@TOC '],
];
```

### Include Other Content Fields

By default, text located in the `$page->title()` and `$page->text()` fields will be included in the exported data. The following option can be added to the `site/config/config.php` file, allowing you to specify other content fields to be included. These fields will be appended after the title and text fields.

This option is not set by default.

```php
return [
	'splorp.paperback-export.fields' => [],
];
```

Specify one or more content fields and their type as an array.

```php
return [
	'splorp.paperback-export.fields' => ['author' => 'text','posts' => 'related'],
];
```

Use the `text` content type for any field containing alphanumberic data, such as an author name or date.

Use the `related` content type for fields formatted using the YAML syntax for [related articles](https://getkirby.com/docs/cookbook/content/related-articles). The title field of each related article or page will be included in the exported data.

### Include Unlisted Pages

By default, every page on your Kirby site will be included in the exported data. The following options can be added to the `site/config/config.php` file, allowing you to filter which pages are included based on certain criteria.

This option is set to true by default.

```php
return [
	'splorp.paperback-export.includeUnlisted' => true,
];
```

### Include Children Pages

Pages specified in this option will not be included, but the children of those pages will be included in the exported data.

This option is not set by default.

```php
return [
	'splorp.paperback-export.includeChildren' => [],
];
```

Specify one or more pages as an array.

```php
return [
	'splorp.paperback-export.includeChildren' => ['blog','newsletter'],
];
```

### Exclude Templates

Pages using the templates specified in this option will be excluded from the exported data.

This option is not set by default.

```php
return [
	'splorp.paperback-export.excludeTemplate' => [],
];
```

Specify one or more templates as an array.

```php
return [
	'splorp.paperback-export.excludeTemplate' => ['about','search'],
