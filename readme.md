# Kirby Paperback Export

Export [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) content for use with the [Paperback Book Maker](https://ritsuko.chuma.org/paperback/).

### What’s a Paperback book, you ask?

Paperback is a simple cross-platform utility created by [David Fedor](http://thefedors.com/pobox/) that takes plain text files and quickly packages them for viewing on a Newton OS device. Since the Paperback utility only runs under classic Mac OS and Windows, an online [Paperback Book Maker](https://ritsuko.chuma.org/paperback/) was developed by [Victor Rehorst](https://github.com/chuma) for all your cross-platform needs.
